## Description

### What's new ?

 - lifeBars are now displaying predator's life when damaged, and queen's life upon the anthill
 - feedback of soldiers actions are now displayed upon them

### What is it ?

This project is a personal training workspace where I work on :
- Threads
- Concurrency
- decisional algorithms
- java performances

It runs a simple visual application wich illustrates the simulation of an anthill. In the back-end, each creep is a thread, accessing various concurrent resources like the anthill's food stock or the food spot's food stock.

### Why Ants ?

Why not ?

### Configuration

You can tweak the simuation by editing some of the values available in [Configuration.java](https://github.com/Tohll/Thread_fourmiliere/blob/Master/src/anthill/utils/Configuration.java)
