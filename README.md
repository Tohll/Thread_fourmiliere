## Description

This project is a personal training workspace where I work on: 
- Threads
- Concurrency
- decisional algorithms
- java performances

It runs a simple visual application wich illustrate the simulation of an anthill. In the back-end, each creep is a thread, accessing various concurrent resources like the anthill's fodd stock or the food spots fodd stocks.
