## Description

### What's new ?

 - predators now seek and destroy queens
 - Queens lose life is can't eat, and regenerate slowly if can eat

### What is it ?

This project is a personal training workspace where I work on :
- Threads
- Concurrency
- decisional algorithms
- java performances

It runs a simple visual application wich illustrate the simulation of an anthill. In the back-end, each creep is a thread, accessing various concurrent resources like the anthill's food stock or the food spots food stocks.
